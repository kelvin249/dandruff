Growing butternut squash in Central Portugal involves planting the seeds directly into the ground after the last frost, typically when soil temperatures have warmed to at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
 In Lisbon, Portugal, the ideal time to plant butternut squash seeds directly into the ground is around March 15.
 However, if you are in a cooler part of Central Portugal, you might want to wait until the soil is warmer and the days are consistently warm to avoid issues with cold or wet conditions that can harm young plants.

Butternut squash plants require a spot that receives 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily and well-drained, fertile soil.
 They are typically harvested in late summer, depending on the climate.
 To ensure a successful harvest, keep the soil moist but not wet and fertilize the plants once during planting and again when blossoms appear.

In Central Portugal, it's important to monitor the weather and soil conditions, as the climate can be harsh with hot summers and cold, wet winters.
 Using techniques such as keyhole beds or raised beds can help manage water and soil temperature, which are crucial for the health of butternut squash plants.

Once harvested, butternut squash can be stored for several months in a cool place like a root cellar or cooked and frozen for up to a year.
 The flavor of butternut squash improves after a few days of storage at room temperature.

For those with limited space, bush varieties of butternut squash can be grown in containers, making them a viable option for smaller gardens or balconies.
